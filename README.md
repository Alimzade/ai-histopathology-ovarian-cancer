# AI for Histopathology: Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification

## Abstract

This repository contains code for ovarian cancer subtype classification using Whole Slide Images (WSI) and Tissue Microarrays (TMA). We explore multiple approaches, including a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) classifier for WSI, encoder and tile-based majority voting for TMA. The MIL classifier demonstrates strong performance, while TMA methods show potential despite generalization challenges. This study emphasizes AI's role in advancing diagnostics and calls for larger datasets and innovative architectures to improve precision and patient outcomes.
